<h1>Lift</h1>

<p>Lift is the key aerodynamic force. It is the upward force created by the effect of
airflow as it passes over and under the wings.</p>

<p>The basic principle of lift is derived from a scientific principle called Bernoulli's
Principle. The basic result of this principle with regard to lift is that when a greater
amount of pressure exists under the wing than over the wing, there exists a lifting action
on the airplane. You have probably experimented with this principle yourself whenever you
have stuck your hand out the window of a moving car. The force that pushes your hand up is
called lift.</p>

<p>Lift is the force that opposes <a href="weight.htm">weight</a>. In straight-and-level,
unaccelerated flight, lift and weight are equal.</p>
