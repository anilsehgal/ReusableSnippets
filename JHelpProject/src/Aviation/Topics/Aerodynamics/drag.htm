<h1>Drag</h1>

<p>Drag is a backward force that limits the speed of an airplane. Drag is caused by any
airplane surface that deflects the airflow around the airplane. For example, extended
landing gear poses additional drag on a flying airplane because the gear deflects airflow
as the airplane moves through the air.</p>

<p>Drag is the force that opposes <a href="thrust.htm">thrust</a> and limits the forward
speed of the airplane. In straight-and-level, unaccelerated flight, drag and thrust are
equal.</p>
