<h1>Weight</h1>

<p>Lift is the downward force of the airplane. Weight changes during flight because the
airplane burns fuel as it flies. Weight can also change during flight maneuvers. An
example of this change is when an airplane is in aerobatic flight. If you've ever gone an
amusement park ride, you probably have experienced a similar effect when the ride makes
your body feel &quot;weightless.&quot;</p>

<p>Weight is the force that opposes <a href="lift.htm">lift</a>. In straight-and-level,
unaccelerated flight, weight and thrust are equal.</p>
