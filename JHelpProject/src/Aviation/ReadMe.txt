Aviation HelpSet
================

The "Aviation" example is used throughout "Creating Effective JavaHelp".
The example is implemented as a HelpSet -- a set of files that make up a
JavaHelp online help project.

We use the Aviation example to demonstrate how JavaHelp works. We also
use it to show how to create and modify online help projects.
