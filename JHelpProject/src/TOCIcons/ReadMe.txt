TOC Icons
=========

These icons provide an alternative to the standard JavaHelp
table of contents (TOC) icons. You can use these icons to
customize a help project's table of contents.

Each online TOC entry can be preceded by an icon; JavaHelp
provides standard icons, which you can easily replace with
your own icons.
