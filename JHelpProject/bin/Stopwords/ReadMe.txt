Word-Search Index Stopwords
===========================

The stopwords text file contains all of the default
stopwords for JavaHelp's word search index. You can
use it if you want to add additional stopwords but
don't want to waste time typing all of the default
stopwords. Simply add your own stopwords to the
bottom of the list.
