<h1>Airports</h1>

<p>It goes without saying that a pilot must know all about airports. For taking off or
landing, the pilot must pay attention to <a href="wind_direction_indicators.htm">wind
direction indicators</a> to know what runway to expect to use.</p>

<p>The pilot must also know all about <a href="Runways%20and%20Taxiways/runways.htm">runways</a>
and <a href="Runways%20and%20Taxiways/taxiways.htm">taxiways</a> and understand what their
<a href="Runways%20and%20Taxiways/markings.htm">markings</a> represent.</p>
