<h1>Runways</h1>

<p>Runways come in different surfaces and sizes. Small recreation airports usually have
very short runways suitable for small aircraft. Some small airports even have grass
runways. Large airports typically have large runways that can handle larger jets.</p>

<p>Runways have <a href="markings.htm#rmark">runway markings</a> to provide special
information to the pilot.</p>
