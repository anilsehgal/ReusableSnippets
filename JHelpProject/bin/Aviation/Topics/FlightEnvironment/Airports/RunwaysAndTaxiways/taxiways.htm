<h1>Taxiways</h1>

<p>Taxiways lead pilots to and from the runway. Many aircraft can be using the same
taxiways at one time. For this reason, and because taxiways cannot handle as much stress
as runways, pilots must operate at slow speeds when taxiing.</p>

<p>Taxiways have <a href="markings.htm#tmark">taxiway markings</a> to guide the pilot
while taxiing.</p>
