<h1>The Fuselage</h1>

<p>The fuselage is what you would consider the &quot;body&quot; of the airplane. It houses
the cockpit and cabin, which houses the airplane's occupants.</p>

<p>The fuselage also serves other functions such as housing luggage and providing a common
attachment for the other airplane parts.</p>
