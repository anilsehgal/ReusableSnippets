<h1>Landing Gear</h1>

<p>The landing gear's function seems obvious, but it actually serves the following two
purposes: 

<ul>
  <li>Absorb the landing load when the airplane lands.</li>
  <li>Support the airplane as it taxis on the ground.</li>
</ul>

<p>Landing gear is either retractable (retracts into the airplane during flight) or fixed
(stays extended during flight).</p>
