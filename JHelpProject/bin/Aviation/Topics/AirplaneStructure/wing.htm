<h1>The Wing</h1>

<p>The wing is responsible for creating <a href="../Aerodynamics/lift.htm">lift</a> so
that the airplane can fly. Wings come in many shapes and sizes depending on their purpose.</p>

<p>Wings contain ailerons to control the airplane's banking and flaps to help the airplane
fly at low airspeeds.</p>
