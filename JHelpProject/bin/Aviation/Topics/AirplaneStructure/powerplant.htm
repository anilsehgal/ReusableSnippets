<h1>The Powerplant</h1>

<p>The powerplant's main function is to provide power to turn the propeller (or jet). In
small airplanes the powerplant includes both the engine and the propeller.</p>

<p>Certain airplanes have a firewall between the engine and the cockpit/cabin to protect
the occupants.</p>
